# ELB17S: High Throughput Sequencing (HTS)

Most high-throughput sequencing machines output [fastq files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format), the “de facto” current standard in HTS. Fastq files are simply text files, where each block of information (a sequenced DNA fragment, or read) in this format is encoded as 4 lines:

	@read_identifier
	read_sequence
	+ separator line
	base_qualities
	
For example, here you have 8 lines of a fastq file, corresponding to 2 sequences:

Each base has a quality character associated with it, representing how confidently the machine identified (called) the base. The probability of error per base is given as a [Phred score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score), calculated from an integer value (Q) derived from the quality character associated to the base. Useful reference values of Q include:
* Q=10 - 90% accuracy
* Q=20 - 99% accuracy
* Q=30 - 99.9% accuracy
* Q=40 - 99.99% accuracy

Although there's theoretically no limit, Q usually goes up to around 40 in recent illumina machines.
